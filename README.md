<h1 style="text-align: center">CompCheck || CS50X final project</h1>

#### Video-demo:  TBD


### Description
This project is the final assignment of Harvards CS50X [Introduction to Computer Science course.](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/project/) The goal of this project is to take the learned programming skills out for a spin and develop my own piece of software.

**CompCheck - Why and what** 
As a former recruiter, Iâ€™ve noticed that it can be challenging to compare employer benefits in a good way. One employer offers you an okay salary, with a nice number of PTO days, but with a nice contribution to your retirement plan, while another company offers a really nice salary but with much worse secondary employment benefits. What is the best job offer down the line?

CompCheck normalizes every job offer to a 40-hour employment contract, selling all non-obligatory PTO days and giving you an overview of what your expected net salary will be.


**For this project I used the following techniques:**
 - Java
 - PostgreSQL
 - Spring boot
 - Thymeleaf
 - HTML/CSS


<h2>Functionalities</h2>

 - [x] Registration form
 - [x] Login page
 - [x] Forms to enter job offers
 - [x] Rendering thymeleaf templates
 - [x] A few really basic unit tests


<h2>Learnings & things to improve in the future</h2>
Next time and in future projects:

 - [ ] Implementing Spring Security for Registration and login
 - [ ] Get a better understanding of OOP & 'Architecture'
 - [ ] Learn how to do more complex unit test
 - [ ] Evaluate / Reconsider UI more 
 - [ ] Every takes longer than you thing ;)
